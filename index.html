#Machine Learning on Microbiome Data: Theory and Practice

The workshop will focus on the theory and application of machine learning to
microbiome datasets, including bacterial and viral communities. The following topics will be
addressed:
- Introduction to supervised machine learning, and how to implement a machine learning
workflow using R and Python.
- Applying machine learning algorithms (such as Random Forest) on microbiome datasets
for disease risk prediction in humans.
- Introduction to bacteria-phage interactions, and how it contributes to bacterial
pathogenicity.
- Applying machine learning methods to predict bacterial pathogenicity induced by
phages.
